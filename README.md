# Codenames Bot

A bot that can play as Spymaster or as a player in the popular card game Codenames. 

## Setup

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. Run `pip install pipenv` and install Python 3.6 (either download `pyenv` and run the line of code below or download manually from the Python website). 

Then you are ready to run the project.

<code>pipenv run python run.py</code>

## Issues

- Spymaster guesses could do with some fine tuning. 
- Has only been tested on OSX so far.
